  **How to Reproduce**
- [x] Read this README.md
- [ ] You will need to download the mushroom.csv for the data contained at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/mushroom-classification?datasetId=478&sortBy=voteCount
- [ ] Use the functions I have created that are contained in my python files
      - You will want the acquire and prepare files for acquiring and prepping data for exploring and modeling
      - I have a seperate python file called charts.py that contains the code for my visuals
- [ ] Have fun doing your own exploring, modeling, and more!
